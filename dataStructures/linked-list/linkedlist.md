  * benefits
    * no size restriction
    * adding new elements in cheap
  * drawbacks
    * no random access
  * explanation
    * each element has a pointer to the next item and a data attribute
    * last element will have a next pointer pointing to null
* circular linked list
  * benefits
    * any node can be starting point in a traversal
  * explanation
    * is linked list but last element points back to first element
* doubly linked list
  * benefits
    * can be traversed backwards and forwards
    * you can insert a node in front of a node without having to traverse the list
